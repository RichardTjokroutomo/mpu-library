# MPU Arduino Library

### introduction
This is an Arduino library for the MPU6050 sensor, mounted on a GY521 breakout board. There are 2 folders:
1) mpu6050_Richard, which contains both the `.cpp` and the `.h` files for the MPU6050 library. There is also a sample code included.
2) mpuCalibrator_Richard, which contains the library needed to calibrate the sensor. Just like mpu6050_Richard, a sample code is also included.

### additional notes
> - This is a high school project I made back in 2020, so I have forgotten the specific details on the code. 
> - I pushed this to my repository in case someone in the future wants to use it in his/her Arduino project.
